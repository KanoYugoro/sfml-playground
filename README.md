# SFML Playground

I created this from this repository template to get started.  `https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project`
The intent is to do some misc development in C++ and get some practice playing with SFML.

## Setup Instructions

1. create the `/build` directory.
1. run `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
1. run `cmake --build build`
1. Run executable at `SFML-PLAYGROUND/build/bin/Debug/SFMLGame.exe`
